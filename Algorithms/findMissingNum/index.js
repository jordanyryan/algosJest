// Given 2 sorted arrays, arr1 and arr2
// Where arr1 has a complete set of numbers, 
// and arr2 has all but 1 number that arr1 has
// So, arr1.length = n and arr2.length = n-1
// You can assume that arr2 will always be missing 
// a number that arr1 has

// Can you find the missing number in arr2, given arr1 ?

// Bonus - Try not to loop through each individual item in the array

// Example -
// const arr1 = [1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10];
// const arr2 = [1,3,4,6,8,9,10];

// findMissingNum(arr1, arr2) ==> 5
